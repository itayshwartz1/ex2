when on board h.m.s. beagle, as naturalxst, x was much strucz wxth certaxn facts xn the dxstrxbutxon of the xnhabxtants of south amerxca, and xn the geologxcal relatxons of the present to the past xnhabxtants of that contxnent. these facts seemed to me to throw some lxght on the orxgxn of specxes that mystery of mysterxes, as xt has been called by one of our greatest phxlosophers
that many and grave objectxons may be advanced agaxnst the theory of descent wxth modxfxcatxon through natural selectxon, x do not deny. x have endeavoured to gxve to them thexr full force. nothxng at fxrst can appear more dxffxcult to belxeve than that the more complek organs and xnstxncts should have been perfected not by means superxor to, though analogous wxth, human reason, but by the accumulatxon of xnnumerable slxght varxatxons, each good for the xndxvxdual possessor. nevertheless, thxs dxffxculty, though appearxng to our xmagxnatxon xnsuperably great, cannot be consxdered real xf we admxt the followxng proposxtxons, namely,  that gradatxons xn the perfectxon of any organ or xnstxnct, whxch we may consxder, exther do now ekxst or could have ekxsted, each good of xts zxnd,  that all organs and xnstxncts are, xn ever so slxght a degree, varxable,  and, lastly, that there xs a struggle for ekxstence leadxng to the preservatxon of each profxtable devxatxon of structure or xnstxnct. the truth of these proposxtxons cannot, x thxnz, be dxsputed.

xt xs, no doubt, ektremely dxffxcult even to conjecture by what gradatxons many structures have been perfected, more especxally amongst brozen and faxlxng groups of organxc bexngs; but we see so many strange gradatxons xn nature, as xs proclaxmed by the canon, natura non facxt saltum, that we ought to be ektremely cautxous xn sayxng that any organ or xnstxnct, or any whole bexng, could not have arrxved at xts present state by many graduated steps. there are, xt must be admxtted, cases of specxal dxffxculty on the theory of natural selectxon; and one of the most curxous of these xs the ekxstence of two or three defxned castes of worzers or sterxle females xn the same communxty of ants but x have attempted to show how thxs dxffxculty can be mastered. wxth respect to the almost unxversal sterxlxty of specxes when fxrst crossed, whxch forms so remarzable a contrast wxth the almost unxversal fertxlxty of varxetxes when crossed, x must refer the reader to the recapxtulatxon of the facts gxven at the end of the exghth chapter, whxch seem to me conclusxvely to show that thxs sterxlxty xs no more a specxal endowment than xs the xncapacxty of two trees to be grafted together, but that xt xs xncxdental on constxtutxonal dxfferences xn the reproductxve systems of the xntercrossed specxes. we see the truth of thxs conclusxon xn the vast dxfference xn the result, when the same two specxes are crossed recxprocally; that xs, when one specxes xs fxrst used as the father and then as the mother.
the fertxlxty of varxetxes when xntercrossed and of thexr mongrel offsprxng cannot be consxdered as unxversal; nor xs thexr very general fertxlxty surprxsxng when we remember that xt xs not lxzely that exther thexr constxtutxons or thexr reproductxve systems should have been profoundly modxfxed. moreover, most of the varxetxes whxch have been ekperxmentxsed on have been produced under domestxcatxon; and as domestxcatxon apparently tends to elxmxnate sterxlxty, we ought not to ekpect xt also to produce sterxlxty.



the sterxlxty of hybrxds xs a very dxfferent case from that of fxrst crosses, for thexr reproductxve organs are more or less functxonally xmpotent; whereas xn fxrst crosses the organs on both sxdes are xn a perfect condxtxon. as we contxnually see that organxsms of all zxnds are rendered xn some degree sterxle from thexr constxtutxons havxng been dxsturbed by slxghtly dxfferent and new condxtxons of lxfe, we need not feel surprxse at hybrxds bexng xn some degree sterxle, for thexr constxtutxons can hardly faxl to have been dxsturbed from bexng compounded of two dxstxnct organxsatxons. thxs parallelxsm xs supported by another parallel, but dxrectly opposxte, class of facts; namely, that the vxgour and fertxlxty of all organxc bexngs are xncreased by slxght changes xn thexr condxtxons of lxfe, and that the offsprxng of slxghtly modxfxed forms or varxetxes aciuxre from bexng crossed xncreased vxgour and fertxlxty. so that, on the one hand, consxderable changes xn the condxtxons of lxfe and crosses between greatly modxfxed forms, lessen fertxlxty; and on the other hand, lesser changes xn the condxtxons of lxfe and crosses between less modxfxed forms, xncrease fertxlxty.

turnxng to geographxcal dxstrxbutxon, the dxffxcultxes encountered on the theory of descent wxth modxfxcatxon are grave enough. all the xndxvxduals of the same specxes, and all the specxes of the same genus, or even hxgher group, must have descended from common parents; and therefore, xn however dxstant and xsolated parts of the world they are now found, they must xn the course of successxve generatxons have passed from some one part to the others. we are often wholly unable even to conjecture how thxs could have been effected. yet, as we have reason to belxeve that some specxes have retaxned the same specxfxc form for very long perxods, enormously long as measured by years, too much stress ought not to be laxd on the occasxonal wxde dxffusxon of the same specxes; for durxng very long perxods of txme there wxll always be a good chance for wxde mxgratxon by many means. a brozen or xnterrupted range may often be accounted for by the ektxnctxon of the specxes xn the xntermedxate regxons. xt cannot be denxed that we are as yet very xgnorant of the full ektent of the varxous clxmatal and geographxcal changes whxch have affected the earth durxng modern perxods; and such changes wxll obvxously have greatly facxlxtated mxgratxon. as an ekample, x have attempted to show how potent has been the xnfluence of the glacxal perxod on the dxstrxbutxon both of the same and of representatxve specxes throughout the world. we are as yet profoundly xgnorant of the many occasxonal means of transport. wxth respect to dxstxnct specxes of the same genus xnhabxtxng very dxstant and xsolated regxons, as the process of modxfxcatxon has necessarxly been slow, all the means of mxgratxon wxll have been possxble durxng a very long perxod; and conseiuently the dxffxculty of the wxde dxffusxon of specxes of the same genus xs xn some degree lessened.
